I thought I'd write a website to help people choose playlists for parties. I find it difficult to decide what to play...so why not have the attendees choose? Consequently, the site should have a list of available songs and the people should vote for certain songs. Not terribly complicated, but fun to write. I'll do it slowly because I don't have all that much free time. I could probably just use a pre-written voting system, but I'd like to write all of it myself.

It goes without saying that I suck at organizing what I need...so I'm just writing shit that hopefully works - whether I need the stuff, I need to audit myself or something, lol.


The parser is finished, and so is the voting system. Probably will have to modify them but the basics are done.

Now I need to display the information. So, I need to do the index.php file. Ajax that shit up. That might take a while as I know very little jQuery but that shouldn't be too hard to learn.
Collection Library
    {
            A document...
            {
                id:
                password_hash:
                expires:
                title:
                descripton:
            }
    }
Collection song
    {
            A document....
            {
                lib_id:
                id:
                metadata
                    {
                        identifier:
                        artist:
                        album:
                        title:
                        location:
                    }
                votes:
                ip_addr:
                     [ip,ip,ip]
            }
    }
indexes needed for mongo:

db.library.ensureIndex({"id": 1}, {unique: true});
db.song.ensureIndex({"votes"});
