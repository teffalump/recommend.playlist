I thought I'd write a website to help people choose playlists for parties. I find it difficult to decide what to play...so why not have the attendees choose? Consequently, the site should have a list of available songs and the people should vote for certain songs. Not terribly complicated, but fun to write. I'll do it slowly because I don't have all that much free time. I could probably just use a pre-written voting system, but I'd like to write all of it myself.


The parser is finished, and so is the voting system. Probably will have to modify them but the basics are done.

Now I need to display the information. So, I need to do the index.php file. Ajax that shit up. That might take a while as I know very little jQuery but that shouldn't be too hard to learn.
