I thought I'd write a website to help people choose playlists for parties. I find it difficult to decide what to play...so why not have the attendees choose? Consequently, the site should have a list of available songs and the people should vote for certain songs. Not terribly complicated, but fun to write. I'll do it slowly because I don't have all that much free time. I could probably just use a pre-written voting system, but I'd like to write all of it myself.
